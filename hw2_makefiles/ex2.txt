1.At what size N does your Euclidean norm start to exhibit unexpected results? What is the approximate
magnitude of the unexpected result? Explain.
When N is about 75, representing the number of entries in my vector, my Euclidean norm starts to exhibit unexpected results.
The unexpected result is that the difference between the Euclidean norm of a random vector in ascending order and the Euclidean norm of the same random
vector in descending order is not exactly zero.  The approximate magnitude of this unexpected difference result from the expected result
of zero is about 10e-16.

2.Is this going to be a problem with our realization of vector spaces as vector<double>?
This will not be a problem for most applications because the error is so low.  Even with a vector with 10000 entries still only exhibits
an error of about 10e-14, which is still a very low error for most applications.

Note: my randomVector function creates a vector with N entries, where each entry is a double between 0 and 1.
