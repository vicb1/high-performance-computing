1.What is the complete string in your bash shell prompt when your working directory is
/home/amath583/work?
The complete string in my prompt when /home/amath583/work is my working directory is the following: "amath583@a784cc4bac10:~$"

2.What is the indicated host name of your amath583/base container? (You will need to ﬁnd the right
Linux command to execute for this.)
The host name is "a784cc4bac10"

3.How do you specify the name of an output ﬁle when you use the compiler?
The following command can be used to specify the name (newName.o in this case) of a output file that can be run in the same way as a.out: "c++ vsum.cpp -o newName.o"

4.(583 only) Describe how you would separately compile the two ﬁles vsum2.cpp and vector.cpp into
object ﬁles and link them to create an executable.
The two files would be separately compiled into object files by doing "c++ -c vsum2.cpp -o one.o" and "c++ -c vector.cpp -o two.o".  The object files would then be linked together by doing "c++ one.o two.o -o vectorExecutable"
