Recall the code and your result from Section2.3. The provided code needed to be modiﬁed to obtain a
meaningful result for the Maximum Performance denominator in computing efﬁciency. Once you have
successfully obtained a value for your computer, provide the following:

See file sect23questions.cpp for code.

1.Description of what changes you made to the timing code
Timing the loop without optimizations takes around 8000ms.  Using the -O3 optimization, the timing results in 0ms without making changes to the code.  When I output the answer of the calculation using the -O3 optimization, the timing results in about 3000ms.

2.Explanation of why you made those changes
I made those changes because I had a feeling that the -O3 optimization does not go through the loop to calculate the answer unless the answer is used to determine the output of the code.

3.Clock rate of your computer


4.Max achieved ﬂoating point rate of your timed code


5.( AMATH 583 only) Under what circumstances, if any, is your matvec_student faster than matvec_inner
and matvec_outer?
matvec_student is faster than both matvec_inner and matvec_outer in cases I've tested with matrices up to 2048x2048 entries.  The method matvec_student uses to become faster is hoisting.
